# Tendon_Limb_Design

The goal of this respository is to show the design behind a Tendon-Driven leg following this basic steps: 

Transformation matrix (T) __Kinetic description

Forward kinematic model G(q) __End point position with orientation also called Geometric  Model

Jacobian (J) __Instantaneous linear and angular endpoint velocities

Moment arm matrix (R(q)) __From a given tendon route and joint radius

Maximum force matrix (F)__Where forces generated by motors go, motor shafts will produce torque values below the stall ones because of movement

Activation matrix a __Show the current activation level of muscles

Feasible wrench space: __w=J[-trnasp]*R*F*a=Ha
